Welcome to the website of BELFORS !

Right now, we are setting up Belgium's first Forecasting research society. 
Our goal is to build an active network of academics and practitioners who are active in forecasting.
Practitioners typically have the interesting - unsolved - problems and academics like a challenge.

BELFORS focusses on "Integrating Forecasting for Decision Making".
